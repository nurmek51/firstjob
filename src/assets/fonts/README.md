# Font Files

To complete the pixel-perfect implementation, you need to add the Mabry Pro font files to this directory:

1. **MabryPro-Regular.woff** and **MabryPro-Regular.woff2** - For font-weight: 400
2. **MabryPro-Medium.woff** and **MabryPro-Medium.woff2** - For font-weight: 500

Once you add these files, the application will automatically use Mabry Pro font throughout the interface.

If you don't have the font files yet, the application will fall back to Inter font.
